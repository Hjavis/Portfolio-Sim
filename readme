# Portfolio Simulator (WIP)

This is a simple Python-based portfolio simulation tool for buying/selling assets, tracking portfolio value, and viewing sector information using historical data from Yahoo Finance.

## Features

- Downloads and caches historical price data (`yfinance`)
- Basic asset purchase and sale simulation
- Tracks cash and share holdings
- Sector tagging and display
- Portfolio valuation

## Known Flaws / Limitations

- **No actual portfolio valuation over time:** Currently only tracks portfolio value based on the last available price or specified date.
- **No transaction history:** Trades aren't logged; no way to track past actions or compute realized PnL.
- **No portfolio rebalancing logic or strategy support.**
- **No support for dividends, splits, or corporate actions.**
- **No risk metrics (e.g., volatility, beta, VaR).**
- **Not time-series aware:** Canâ€™t analyze portfolio evolution across time (daily NAV tracking missing).
- **Basic error handling:** Error messages exist but lack depth and structure.
- **Global state usage (`portfolio`, `current_cash`)** is fragile and not scalable.

## Next Steps
- Implement portfolio class, def buy,sell etc.
- Add proper time-series portfolio valuation (NAV over time)
- Implement a transaction log (buy/sell history)
- Add support for plotting value & performance over time
- Include basic performance/risk analytics
- Modularize code and improve structure
- Eventually extend toward options/derivatives pricing and backtesting capabilities
